# Project Metal Battle 🎸📊
*An exploratory data analysis project using a 2021 Spotify dataset to compare the attributes of Metallica and Sepultura.*

## 🎯 The Mission
Analyzing the acoustic variables of valence, energy, and popularity to compare the highly varied discography of Metallica against the highly specialized, concentrated sound of Sepultura.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack (The Engine)
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Kaggle / Jupyter / Colab

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **The Core Finding:** Sepultura's acoustic profile is highly concentrated within its specific sub-genre, while Metallica's data points are widely spread out, proving a much more varied musical evolution.
2. **The Anomaly:** Despite general industry trends, acoustic variables within this specific dataset showed zero correlation with a track's overall popularity.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Run the `.ipynb` notebook to view the interactive dashboards.
